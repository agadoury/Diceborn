# Pact of Heroes

A 1v1 dice-and-card duel. Each player picks a hero with their own dice
faces, ability ladder, signature passive, and card pool, then takes
alternating turns rolling, locking, and playing cards to chase
combos that fire abilities. Match length: 5–8 minutes; play it in a
browser tab on mobile or desktop, or install it as a PWA.

> **Status: MVP under active development.** Three playable heroes
> (Berserker, Pyromancer, Lightbearer), hot-seat and Vs AI modes, a deck
> builder, and the full juice layer (dice tumble, hit-stop, screen
> shake, ability cinematics, status-token slam-ins, per-hero
> atmospherics) are in. Expect rough edges; tuning, content, and polish
> are all ongoing.

## Stack

- Vite + React 18 + TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS (mobile-first; `lg: 1024px` is the mobile → desktop boundary)
- Zustand for state, Framer Motion + GSAP for animation, Howler-ready audio
- Vitest for engine tests
- vite-plugin-pwa for service worker, manifest, install prompts

## Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run dev         # http://localhost:5173
npm run build       # tsc + vite build
npm run preview     # preview production build
npm test            # vitest run

```

The rules engine emits a `GameEvent[]` from every `applyAction` call. The
**Choreographer** consumes that list and runs it as a timed sequence —
hit-stops, screen shake, dice tumble, ability cinematics, status-token
slam-ins. The store enqueues events but does not block — UI components
gate their interactivity on `useInputUnlocked()` (queue drained).

This separation is what enables the juice: the engine resolves a turn
instantly; the presentation layer takes 2-6 seconds to *show* it.

## Heroes

Three heroes ship with the current build:

- **The Berserker** — rush archetype, frost-blue twin-axe warrior. Closes via Wolf's Howl on the rare 5-howl roll. See [`docs/content/berserker/design.md`](./docs/content/berserker/design.md).
- **The Pyromancer** — burn archetype, builds Cinder to critical-mass detonations. Career-moment T4 is God's Crater (5 ruin). See [`docs/content/pyromancer/design.md`](./docs/content/pyromancer/design.md).
- **The Lightbearer** — survival archetype, banks Radiance and closes with Judgment of the Sun (5 zenith). See [`docs/content/lightbearer/design.md`](./docs/content/lightbearer/design.md).

All three follow the canonical offensive ladder shape: 1× T1 + 3× T2 + 2× T3 + 1× T4, with the T4 always gated on `5× face-6`. To add a fourth hero, drop a `HeroDefinition` module in `src/content/heroes/` and register it in `src/content/index.ts`. See [`docs/authoring/hero-spec.md`](./docs/authoring/hero-spec.md) for the authoring contract.

Landing-rate audit runs against whichever heroes are registered:

```sh
npm run simulate -- --rates
```

## Mobile-first acceptance

Every step's done-check happens on iPhone (Safari, or Chrome DevTools at
iPhone 14 Pro / 390×844). Touch targets ≥44pt (≥56pt for primary actions),
tap-not-hover interactions, long-press for inspect, haptic feedback on
dice settle / damage / abilities (Android Chrome — iOS Safari ignores the
Vibration API and gracefully no-ops).

## Bundle

`npm run build` ships:
- JS:  ~140 KB gzipped (under 400 KB budget)
- CSS: ~7 KB gzipped
- PWA precache: ~480 KiB total (under 1.2 MB budget)

## How to add or update heroes & cards

[`docs/authoring/workflow.md`](./docs/authoring/workflow.md) is the operational guide. It covers four scenarios — adding a new hero, adding cards to an existing hero, tuning an existing hero, and updating or removing cards — and lists the files to touch, validation steps, and CHANGELOG rules for each. The design contract lives in [`docs/authoring/hero-spec.md`](./docs/authoring/hero-spec.md); references in [`docs/authoring/cheatsheet.md`](./docs/authoring/cheatsheet.md) and [`docs/authoring/examples.md`](./docs/authoring/examples.md).

Quick shape: hero data in `src/content/heroes/<id>.ts`, cards in `src/content/cards/<id>.ts`, register both in the matching `index.ts`, then add a hero design page in `docs/content/<id>/design.md` + a card listing in `docs/content/<id>/cards.md`. Canonical ladder is 1× T1 + 3× T2 + 2× T3 + 1× T4 (Ultimate gated on `5× face-6`).

The engine itself never changes when adding a hero. If the hero needs a genuinely new mechanic category (a new `PassiveBehavior` kind, a new effect primitive), add it generically — that's a separate PR before the hero PR.

## Documentation

- [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md) — **start here.** Routes by intent: I'm a player, adding a hero, tuning, fixing the engine, working on UI.
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) — design + architecture decisions over time. Read before proposing one that might contradict an earlier one.
- [`docs/engine/README.md`](./docs/engine/README.md) — game rules, engine architecture, event flow.
- [`docs/ui/README.md`](./docs/ui/README.md) — match-screen layout, overlays, choreography, design tokens.
- [`docs/design/deck-building.md`](./docs/design/deck-building.md) — deck composition, builder UI, persistence, validator.
- [`docs/content/`](./docs/content/) — per-hero card listings + the universal generic pool.
- [`docs/content/`](./docs/content/) — per-hero design notes (lore, dice, ability roles, tuning rationale; data lives in `src/content/`).
- [`docs/authoring/hero-spec.md`](./docs/authoring/hero-spec.md) — hero-authoring brief (design contract). Operational companion in [`docs/authoring/workflow.md`](./docs/authoring/workflow.md); references in [`docs/authoring/`](./docs/authoring/) (cheat sheet + worked examples).
